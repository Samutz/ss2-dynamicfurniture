# About
This is a [Mutagen](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen) app I wrote to automate the creation of a [Sim Settlements 2](https://simsettlements2.com) addon that adds furniture from [Dynamic Furniture](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84343) to SS2's furniture store system. 

I did this instead of using the Creation Kit or xEdit because there's over 280 furniture objects in Dynamic Furniture and I didn't want to manually create the records needed (at least 2 for each furniture) to make them work with SS2's furniture store system. xEdit has a scripting system that could have been used, but the scripts are writen in pascal which is way more foreign to me than .net/C#.

At the time of writing this, I plan to also add at least one furniture store building plan to the addon, but that will be done the normal way using the CK and xEdit. This app also creates copies of the furniture items to be used in the building plan as functional "demo" furniture for the player/customers to try out. I originally had these register to SS2's display system which allows them to spawn on any furnitre store plots, but they aren't usable on those plots, so I will add them to my own building plans a different way.
