# About
This is a [Mutagen](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen) app I wrote to automate the creation of a [Sim Settlements 2](https://simsettlements2.com) addon that adds furniture from [Dynamic Furniture](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84343) to SS2's furniture store system. The final addon can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/93778).

I did this instead of using the Creation Kit or xEdit because there's over 280 furniture objects in Dynamic Furniture and I didn't want to manually create/copy-paste the records needed (at least 2 for each furniture) to make them work with SS2's furniture store system. xEdit has a scripting system that could have been used, but those scripts are writen in pascal which is way more foreign to me than .net/C#.

I also added two furniture store building plans to final addon after using this app to create the plugin file, but that was done the standard way (CK and xEdit).
